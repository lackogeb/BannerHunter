## Bannerhunter
**Bannerhunter** is a powerful banner grabbing tool written in C.
It can connect to services running on different ports, attempt plain TCP grabs, and also perform SSL/TLS handshakes for encrypted services.
The tool sends protocol-appropriate requests (like `HEAD` with `Host` headers for HTTP/HTTPS) to increase the chance of extracting banners.

## Features

- Works on both **Linux** and **Termux**

- Supports **plain TCP** and **SSL/TLS** connections

- Sends proper `Host` headers for HTTP/HTTPS

- Can attempt banner grabs across multiple ports (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMTP, and custom services).

- Receive timeout handling to prevent hangs when services donâ€™t respond

- Installer and uninstaller scripts for easy setup and removal

**Example (Multiple Ports):**
```bash
bannerhunter example.com 21 22 25 80 443
```
Connects to `example.com` on ports `21`, `22`, `25`, `80`, and `443`, grabbing banners from each service.
